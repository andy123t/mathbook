\section{The first section}\label{my label}
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.

\subsection{A sub section}
LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. For example consider this document:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:trifun}
\sin^2{\theta}+\cos^2{\theta}=1.
\end{equation}

LaTeX is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers, and to let authors get on with writing documents. So, in LaTeX you would input this document as:
$ \Rightarrow $
\begin{align}
a & = b + c \\
& = d + e.
\end{align}

Assuming that the disturbance errors of $f$ and $u_{N,0}$ are $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{u}_{N,0}$ respectively, the error of the numerical solution $u_N$ is $\tilde{u}_N$.

An example of the \verb|\cite| command to cite within the book:

This statement requires citation \cite{Adams2003} and \cite{Shen1994,Tadmor2012,TreWei2014}
